        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Megan Filo, a software engineer currently living in Milwaukee,
          Wisconsin (or as Alice Cooper calls it, 'The Good Land'). üßÄ üêÑ üç∫
        </p>
        <p>I make websites and web apps of all shapes and sizes. I love working on projects that are focused around building the web presence of non-profits and small businesses, as well as creating UI that is accessible to all types of end users. The majority of my experience lies in frontend web development, but I enjoy working with backend code and Content Management Systems.</p>
        <p>
          I originally moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2016 to start a career
          in the music business. I landed a job with a major record label that
          involved creating and maintaining e-commerce shops for artists that
          occasionally had me doing basic HTML updates and some fun graphic
          design work for social media content. At another record label gig, I
          created and maintained Shopify stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those tiny pieces of web development work sparked my interest and I
          was ready to learn more. After a year of late nights and weekends of
          self-study, I landed my first web developer gig in 2019. Since then, I
          have continued to learn more about many aspects of front-end and
          back-end web development and picking up new technologies when I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I‚Äôm not staring deeply into a text editor, I‚Äôm usually playing
          video games, playing some kind of musical instrument, out getting ice
          cream with my husband, or spending quality cuddle time with our dog,
          Milo.
        </p>

          I also play drums ü•Å. You can catch me playing around the U.S. with a
          badass artist named
